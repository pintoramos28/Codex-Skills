# Output Guidelines

Keep documents concise and implementation‑ready.

## Length Targets
- Architecture Overview: 1–2 pages
- Feature Design Spec: 1–2 pages
- API Design: 1–2 pages
- Data Model: 1–2 pages
- Non‑Functional Requirements: 1 page
- Test Plan: 1 page
- ADR: 0.5–1 page
- Plan: variable, but list only actionable tasks

## Depth Model
- L1 Summary: 3–6 bullets
- L2 Design Detail: structured artifacts, tables, contracts
- L3 Implementation Notes: only when non‑trivial or risky

## Style
- Prefer bullets and tables
- Avoid duplicate context; link to canonical sections
- Use appendices for long details

## Traceability
- Every document has a DOC ID (e.g., DOC:ARCH-001).
- Every section has a SEC ID (e.g., SEC:ARCH-L2).
- Every actionable item, decision, or requirement has an ID (e.g., ID:COMP-001).
- Cross-reference related IDs across docs.
