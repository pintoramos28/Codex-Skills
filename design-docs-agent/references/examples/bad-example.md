# Design Doc (Bad Example) (DOC:BAD-001)

We should build a thing to upload CSVs. It’s probably easy. We can use some API and a database. The UI should look nice. The details can be figured out during implementation. (ID:BAD-001)

API: POST /upload, GET /data. (ID:BAD-002)

Data model: some tables, maybe JSON. (ID:BAD-003)

Tests: do some tests. (ID:BAD-004)

Timeline: soon. (ID:BAD-005)
